This project focuses on developing a web-based interface for soil test analysis using HTML. The goal is to create a simple and user-friendly platform where users can input soil test data such as pH level, moisture 
content, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium values. The interface helps farmers, gardeners, and agricultural experts easily understand soil health and make informed decisions for crop cultivation.
By using basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the project presents the data in a clear, organized manner and can also suggest suitable crops or fertilizers based on the test results. 
This digital solution promotes efficient farming practices and supports sustainable agriculture.
